# Project Title

VeggieRadar: The solution to all your finding-vegan-food needs. VeggieRadar is a convenient app where users can use and interact with our growing library of vegan restaurants and
vegan options at non-vegan restaurants. Basically- if you want to find hot vegan food in your area, this app is right for you. It includes features that allow users to add their own 
entries and review existing entries, all in familiar and easy to navigate formatting. 

## Getting Started

To open this web application simply clone this repo onto some folder on your local computer. Once you've done that, you can access the main page by opening the index.html file in 
a browser of your choosing. You can also access the about page by either navigating from the already-opened-up index.html, or by clicking on the about.html file itself. If you did not 
modify the location of any files in this project everything should work- so if you're having issues, try making sure all the files are where they should be when referenced with "src=" "" tags in the HTML.

### Prerequisites

You need a browser and a computer as well as the appropriate storage space to open this project.

## Built With

* [Frontend](https://sharp-babbage-30c7ac.netlify.com/) The app itself was built using React.JS (the part the user sees when using the app)
* [Backend] The app functionality on the backend was built using Java
